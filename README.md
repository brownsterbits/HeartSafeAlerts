### From Source

1. Clone the repository:

## Architecture

HeartSafeAlerts uses a clean, modular architecture with separation of concerns:

### Core Managers
- **HeartRateMonitor**: Coordinator that manages data flow and orchestrates other managers
- **BluetoothManager**: Handles all CoreBluetooth operations (scanning, connecting, data parsing)
- **HealthKitManager**: Handles Apple Watch integration via HealthKit
- **AlertManager**: Manages alert logic, thresholds, cooldowns, and notifications
- **SessionStatistics**: Tracks session metrics (min/max/avg, time in/out of range)

### Data Flow
```
Bluetooth Device OR Apple Watch
         ↓
BluetoothManager OR HealthKitManager
         ↓
   HeartRateMonitor (coordinator)
         ↓
    AlertManager → Notifications/Sounds/Vibrations
         ↓
  SessionStatistics → UI Updates
```

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Swift 6.0+ with strict concurrency checking
- **UI**: SwiftUI
- **Frameworks**:
  - CoreBluetooth (BLE heart rate monitors)
  - HealthKit (Apple Watch integration)
  - UserNotifications (background alerts)
  - AVFoundation (sound playback)
  - Combine (reactive data flow)

### Building

**Simulator (iPhone 16 recommended):**
```bash
xcodebuild -project HeartSafeAlerts.xcodeproj \
  -scheme HeartSafeAlerts \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' \
  build
```

**Physical Device (required for Bluetooth testing):**
```bash
xcodebuild -project HeartSafeAlerts.xcodeproj \
  -scheme HeartSafeAlerts \
  -configuration Release \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' \
  build
```

### Testing

Bluetooth functionality requires a physical iOS device and compatible heart rate monitor. Apple Watch functionality can be tested with a paired Apple Watch.

**Note**: Bluetooth LE does not work reliably in the iOS Simulator.
