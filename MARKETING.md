Imagine your heart rate alerts don't just notify YOU—they notify the people who care about you most.

Care Circle is the human connection layer we're building next:

When your heart rate is concerning and you don't respond, Care Circle automatically notifies your trusted contacts. Your spouse. Your adult children. Your workout partner. Whoever you choose.

💬 CHECK-IN WORKFLOW
Simple "I'm Okay" button stops escalation. Or "Need Help" brings immediate support. Your circle sees your status in real-time.

📊 WEEKLY SUMMARIES
Your circle gets plain-language health updates: "This week: 2 alerts, both resolved quickly. Status: Stable." Never overwhelming, always informed.

📈 HISTORICAL INSIGHTS
Trend analysis, exportable reports, pattern recognition. Share with doctors or keep for yourself.

👥 UP TO 5 CIRCLE MEMBERS
Your inner circle. The people who'd want to know.

Care Circle will launch as an optional premium feature ($2.99/month or $19.99/year). Think of it like Life360 for heart health—except the monitoring is already free. You only pay if you want to bring others into the loop.

Everything in Version 2.0 stays FREE forever. Care Circle is for those who want that extra layer of connection and peace of mind.

HeartSafeAlerts 2.0: When you tear down a premium app and rebuild it completely free 🚀

Three months ago, HeartSafeAlerts was a $4.99 premium app. Today, we're launching version 2.0 with a radical change: everything is free. Forever.

Why rebuild from scratch?

Because we learned that heart health monitoring isn't a premium feature—it's a necessity. Athletes avoiding overtraining injuries. Seniors wanting peace of mind. People with heart conditions needing reliable tracking. These aren't premium users. They're people who need tools that work.

What's new in 2.0:

✨ Complete architectural rewrite (66% code complexity reduction)
✨ Apple Watch support via HealthKit integration
✨ Dual data source management (Bluetooth + Apple Watch)
✨ Advanced session statistics (min/max/avg, time in/out of range)
✨ Everything that was premium is now free. No subscriptions. No limits.

The business model:

Version 2.0 is free forever. Our upcoming Care Circle feature (Q2 2025) will add family notifications and health sharing as an optional $2.99/month subscription—but only for those who want that extra connection layer. Solo monitoring stays free for everyone.

Technical highlights:

Built with Swift 6 strict concurrency, modern SwiftUI architecture, Combine for reactive data flow. Clean separation: AlertManager, BluetoothManager, HealthKitManager, SessionStatistics. Open source on GitHub for full transparency.

Why this matters:

Health tech has a monetization problem. We chase premium features instead of solving real problems. Version 2.0 is our bet that accessibility builds better products than paywalls do.

Sometimes the right business decision is to give more away.

### Product Hunt Description
```
HeartSafeAlerts 2.0 - We tore down our premium app and rebuilt it completely free

🔥 The Story:
Three months ago, HeartSafeAlerts was a $4.99 premium iOS app. Today, we're launching 2.0 with everything free. Forever.

Why? Because we realized we had it backwards. Heart health monitoring isn't a luxury—it's a necessity.

🎯 What It Does:
Professional-grade heart rate monitoring on iPhone. Connect ANY Bluetooth heart rate monitor (Polar, Wahoo, Garmin, etc.) OR your Apple Watch. Get instant alerts when you're out of range. Track detailed session statistics. All free. No limits.

💎 What's New in 2.0:
• Complete architectural rewrite (66% code complexity reduction)
• Apple Watch support via HealthKit
• Dual data source management (auto-switching or manual)
• Advanced session stats (min/max/avg, time in/out of range)
• Everything that was premium → now FREE
• Open source on GitHub for full transparency

✨ What Makes This Special:
1. ONLY app supporting BOTH Bluetooth monitors AND Apple Watch
2. ONLY heart monitoring app that's 100% free (no feature locks, no time limits)
3. ONLY app with upcoming family notification features (Care Circle)
4. Privacy-first: all processing on-device, zero cloud, zero tracking
5. Open source: inspect the code, contribute improvements

🚀 What's Next:
Care Circle (Q2 2025) will add family notifications and health sharing as optional premium ($2.99/mo). Think Life360 for heart health. But solo monitoring stays FREE forever.

The bet: Accessibility builds better products than paywalls.

🛠️ Built With:
Swift 6 strict concurrency, SwiftUI, Combine, CoreBluetooth, HealthKit. Modern iOS architecture with clean separation of concerns: AlertManager, BluetoothManager, HealthKitManager, SessionStatistics.

Made by a solo developer who believes health tech should serve everyone, not just those who can afford premium subscriptions.

**HeartSafeAlerts 2.0: Solo Developer Rebuilds Premium App as Completely Free Heart Monitoring Platform**

*Major Rewrite Makes Professional-Grade Heart Rate Monitoring Accessible to Everyone*

**[CITY, STATE] – January 16, 2025** – HeartSafeAlerts, an iOS application for real-time heart rate monitoring and alerts, today launched version 2.0—a complete rebuild that eliminates all premium features and makes professional-grade heart monitoring completely free.

"We rebuilt the entire app from the ground up because we realized the premium model was wrong," said Chad Brown, solo developer of HeartSafeAlerts. "Heart rate monitoring isn't a premium feature—it's a necessity for athletes, seniors, and people with heart conditions. Version 2.0 is our commitment to making these tools accessible to everyone who needs them, regardless of their ability to pay."

**Key Features Now Available Free:**

**Technical Highlights:**

The v1.1 release includes a complete architecture refactoring, resulting in a 66% reduction in code complexity through clean separation of concerns. The app now features dedicated managers for Bluetooth connectivity, HealthKit integration, alert logic, and session statistics, making it more reliable and maintainable.

**Open Source Commitment:**

HeartSafeAlerts is now open source on GitHub, allowing developers to inspect the code, contribute improvements, and build upon the foundation for their own health monitoring needs.

**Future Development:**

The company plans to launch Care Circle, an optional premium subscription feature ($2.99/month or $19.99/year) that will add family notifications, alert escalation, check-in workflows, and weekly health summaries. All current free features will remain free forever.

HeartSafeAlerts requires iOS 18.4 or later and works with any Bluetooth LE heart rate monitor or Apple Watch Series 4 and newer.

Built with Swift 6 and modern iOS frameworks, the app processes all health data locally on the user's device. The project is open source on GitHub and welcomes community contributions.

**The Free Revolution:**

Version 2.0's transition from premium to free reflects a fundamental shift in philosophy: health monitoring tools should be accessible to everyone who needs them, not just those who can afford premium subscriptions. All current features remain free forever. The upcoming Care Circle premium feature (family notifications and health sharing) will be optional for users who want that additional layer of connection.

**Important Notice:**

HeartSafeAlerts is not a medical device and should not be used for medical diagnosis or treatment. Users should always consult healthcare professionals for medical advice.

## FAQ for App Store & Support

### General Questions

**Q: How much does HeartSafeAlerts cost?**
A: HeartSafeAlerts is completely free. All features—Bluetooth monitoring, Apple Watch support, alerts, and statistics—are available at no cost. In the future, we'll offer an optional Care Circle subscription ($2.99/month) for family notifications, but core monitoring will always be free.

**Q: What devices are compatible?**
A: Any Bluetooth LE heart rate monitor (Polar, Wahoo, Garmin, Scosche, 4iiii, CooSpo, etc.) and Apple Watch Series 4 or newer. Requires iOS 18.4+.

**Q: Do I need an Apple Watch?**
A: No! HeartSafeAlerts works great with affordable Bluetooth heart rate monitors like the Polar H10 ($90) or Wahoo TICKR ($50). Apple Watch support is a bonus, not a requirement.

**Q: Does this work in the background?**
A: Yes! Enable background notifications in Settings. The app will monitor your heart rate and send push notifications even when the app is closed.

**Q: Is my health data private?**
A: Absolutely. All heart rate processing happens on your device. We don't collect, store, or transmit your health data to any servers. No account required, no tracking, no data selling.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why isn't my Bluetooth device connecting?**
A: Make sure your heart rate monitor is powered on and in pairing mode. Check that Bluetooth is enabled on your iPhone. Try refreshing the connection by tapping the status banner. Some monitors require wearing them to pair (they activate with skin contact).

**Q: Can I use multiple devices?**
A: Currently, the app connects to one Bluetooth device at a time. You can switch between Bluetooth and Apple Watch using the data source picker in Settings, and "Automatic" mode will choose the best available source.

**Q: What's the difference between Sound, Vibration, and Background Notifications?**
A:
- Sound Alerts: Play immediately when app is open
- Vibration Alerts: Haptic feedback when app is open
- Background Notifications: Push notifications that work even when app is closed

You can enable all three for maximum coverage.

**Q: Why do I see "No Signal" or "Stale Data"?**
A: This means the app hasn't received heart rate data in over 5 seconds. Check that your monitor is positioned correctly, has battery, and is within Bluetooth range. For Apple Watch, ensure it's unlocked and on your wrist.

**Q: How accurate is the heart rate monitoring?**
A: The app displays data directly from your device (Bluetooth monitor or Apple Watch). Accuracy depends on your heart rate sensor. Chest straps (Polar H10, Wahoo TICKR) are generally more accurate than optical (wrist-based) sensors.

### Care Circle Questions

**Q: When will Care Circle launch?**
A: We're targeting Q2 2025 (April-June). We're building it carefully to ensure privacy, reliability, and a great user experience.

**Q: Will Care Circle require a subscription?**
A: Yes, Care Circle will be $2.99/month or $19.99/year. All current features (monitoring, alerts, statistics) will remain free forever.

**Q: What will Care Circle do?**
A: Care Circle will:
- Let you invite up to 5 trusted contacts
- Automatically notify them if you don't respond to alerts
- Provide a check-in workflow ("I'm okay" / "Need help")
- Send weekly health summaries to your circle
- Show historical trends and data

**Q: Can I opt out of Care Circle?**
A: Absolutely! Care Circle is completely optional. If you're happy with the free features, nothing changes for you.

### Support Questions

**Q: How do I report a bug?**
