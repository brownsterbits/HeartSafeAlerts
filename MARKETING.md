## FAQ for App Store & Support

### General Questions

**Q: How much does HeartSafeAlerts cost?**
A: HeartSafeAlerts is completely free. All features—Bluetooth monitoring, Apple Watch support, alerts, and statistics—are available at no cost. In the future, we'll offer an optional Care Circle subscription ($2.99/month) for family notifications, but core monitoring will always be free.

**Q: What devices are compatible?**
A: Any Bluetooth LE heart rate monitor (Polar, Wahoo, Garmin, Scosche, 4iiii, CooSpo, etc.) and Apple Watch Series 4 or newer. Requires iOS 18.4+.

**Q: Do I need an Apple Watch?**
A: No! HeartSafeAlerts works great with affordable Bluetooth heart rate monitors like the Polar H10 ($90) or Wahoo TICKR ($50). Apple Watch support is a bonus, not a requirement.

**Q: Does this work in the background?**
A: Yes! Enable background notifications in Settings. The app will monitor your heart rate and send push notifications even when the app is closed.

**Q: Is my health data private?**
A: Absolutely. All heart rate processing happens on your device. We don't collect, store, or transmit your health data to any servers. No account required, no tracking, no data selling.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why isn't my Bluetooth device connecting?**
A: Make sure your heart rate monitor is powered on and in pairing mode. Check that Bluetooth is enabled on your iPhone. Try refreshing the connection by tapping the status banner. Some monitors require wearing them to pair (they activate with skin contact).

**Q: Can I use multiple devices?**
A: Currently, the app connects to one Bluetooth device at a time. You can switch between Bluetooth and Apple Watch using the data source picker in Settings, and "Automatic" mode will choose the best available source.

**Q: What's the difference between Sound, Vibration, and Background Notifications?**
A:
- Sound Alerts: Play immediately when app is open
- Vibration Alerts: Haptic feedback when app is open
- Background Notifications: Push notifications that work even when app is closed

You can enable all three for maximum coverage.

**Q: Why do I see "No Signal" or "Stale Data"?**
A: This means the app hasn't received heart rate data in over 5 seconds. Check that your monitor is positioned correctly, has battery, and is within Bluetooth range. For Apple Watch, ensure it's unlocked and on your wrist.

**Q: How accurate is the heart rate monitoring?**
A: The app displays data directly from your device (Bluetooth monitor or Apple Watch). Accuracy depends on your heart rate sensor. Chest straps (Polar H10, Wahoo TICKR) are generally more accurate than optical (wrist-based) sensors.

### Care Circle Questions

**Q: When will Care Circle launch?**
A: We're targeting Q2 2025 (April-June). We're building it carefully to ensure privacy, reliability, and a great user experience.

**Q: Will Care Circle require a subscription?**
A: Yes, Care Circle will be $2.99/month or $19.99/year. All current features (monitoring, alerts, statistics) will remain free forever.

**Q: What will Care Circle do?**
A: Care Circle will:
- Let you invite up to 5 trusted contacts
- Automatically notify them if you don't respond to alerts
- Provide a check-in workflow ("I'm okay" / "Need help")
- Send weekly health summaries to your circle
- Show historical trends and data

**Q: Can I opt out of Care Circle?**
A: Absolutely! Care Circle is completely optional. If you're happy with the free features, nothing changes for you.

### Support Questions

**Q: How do I report a bug?**
A: Open an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/brownsterbits/HeartSafeAlerts/issues

**Q: Can I suggest features?**
A: Yes! GitHub issues are the best place for feature requests. We review every suggestion.

**Q: Is HeartSafeAlerts a medical device?**
A: No. HeartSafeAlerts is a wellness app, not a medical device. It's not intended for diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of disease. Always consult healthcare professionals for medical advice.

**Q: Can I contribute to development?**
A: Yes! HeartSafeAlerts is open source. Check out the GitHub repository, read CLAUDE.md for development guidance, and submit pull requests.
