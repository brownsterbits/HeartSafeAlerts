COMING SOON: CARE CIRCLE (The Next Evolution)
═══════════════════════════════

Version 2.0 gives you everything for free. But what if you want more?

Imagine your heart rate alerts don't just notify YOU—they notify the people who care about you most.

Care Circle is the human connection layer we're building next:

💚 ALERT YOUR LOVED ONES
When your heart rate is concerning and you don't respond, Care Circle automatically notifies your trusted contacts.

✅ CHECK-IN WORKFLOWS
"Are you okay?" → Tap "I'm Fine" → Everyone's notified you're safe. Simple, fast, reassuring.

📈 WEEKLY SUMMARIES
Your circle gets weekly health summaries: "Chad's heart rate was stable this week. Avg: 72 BPM."

📊 HEALTH TRENDS
Historical data, charts, and trends. Share as much or as little as you want.

Care Circle will be optional ($2.99/month, launching Q2 2025). All Version 2.0 features stay FREE forever.

Think of it like Life360 for heart health—except the monitoring is already free. You only pay if you want to bring others into the loop.

Version 1 had the wrong business model. Version 2 fixes that.
